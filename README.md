# Example setup for Apache Fuseki RDF SPARQL server with test data

    ./fuseki-server --file RDF/sample_news.nt /news

For my own research I usually use the DBPedia and WikiData SPARQL endpoints but I also need to serve my own RDF assets during development.

I created this simple repo (that is really just the standard Apache Jena Fuseki binary distribution with my notes and data files added) for quick setup and testing on my laptops or leased servers.

I cover various semantic web and linked data topics in many of my books, but suually use public SPARQL endpoints for examples. I plan on extending these examples using local Apache Jena Fuseki SPARQL endpoints.
